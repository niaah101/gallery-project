This project is intended to display a flexbox gallery of my personal photos taken while traveling to several destinations.  

There is a landing page which allows a person to login prior to accessing the gallery.  The only requirement is that the username is "pretty" and the password is "cloudz".  The “:nth child” selector was used to create the landing page logo, along with animation.

There is a hamburger menu used for responsive navigation.

The about.html page is simple and has only a couple of paragraphs of information and gives credit for the photo used on the landing page (index.html).

There are media queries used to change the style of the logo and navigation for both a min-width of 360px, 768px, and 1024px.  The !important property was used on the 768px media query in order for the display to change for the menulinks class.  It wouldn't recognize the change without it.

The Home page is actually linked to gallery.html, and the Exit option is linked to the index.html page.  Links to all pages of the menu will open in the parent window, and not a new window intentionally.

Finally, hover over all the photos to find the angel pic.  It looks just a little different than the rest!
