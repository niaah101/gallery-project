This project is intended to display a flexbox gallery of my personal photos taken while traveling to several destinations.  

There is a landing page which allows a person to login prior to accessing the gallery.  The only requirement is that the username is "pretty" and the password is "cloudz".

There is a hamburger menu used for responsive navigation.

The about.html page is simple and has only a paragraph of information and gives credit for the photo used on the landing page, index.html.

There are media queries used to change the style of the logo and navigation for both a min-width of 360px, 768px, and 1024px.

The Home page is actually linked to gallery.html, and the Log Out option is linked to the index.html page.

Finally, hover over all the photos to find the angel pic.  It looks just a little different than the rest!
