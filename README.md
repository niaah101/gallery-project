This project is intended to display a flexbox gallery of my personal photos taken while traveling to several destinations.  

There is a landing page which allows a person to login prior to accessing the gallery.  The only requirement is that the username is "pretty" and the password is "cloudz". Entering the wrong credentials will prompt an error message. This is done through Javascript.  The “:nth child” selector was used to create the landing page logo, along with animation.

There is a hamburger menu used for responsive navigation on smaller screens and expands on larger screens to standard menu layout.  Based mobile first approach on iPhone5 size when one of testers couldn't see the logo on the landing page. Then I used media queries from there.

There are media queries used to change the style of the logo and navigation for both a min-width of 360px, 768px, and 1024px.  The !important property was used on the 768px media query in order for the display to change for the menulinks class.  It wouldn't recognize the change without it.

The about.html page is simple and has only a couple of paragraphs of information and gives credit for the photo used on the landing page (index.html).

The Home page is actually linked to gallery.html, and the Exit option is linked to the index.html page.  Links to all pages of the menu will open in the parent window, and not a new window intentionally.

I sent the github pages link to my team at work and several of my friends and family to test.  All confirmed site is working as expected.  I tested it on my laptop, cell, and desktop for work and confirmed the same.

There are some things that I would have done differently.  Like the structure of the gallery.html page and the container housing the photos for more styling options. Even the addition of details on each photo.  I am thinking of doing it anyway after the class ends. I like the simplicity of the site though, and actually used a color picker to match the background color chosen to the picture on the landing page.  Love that option for color selection!

Finally, hover over all the photos to find the angel pic.  It looks just a little different than the rest!
