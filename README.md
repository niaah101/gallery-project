This project is intended to display a flexbox gallery of my personal photos taken while traveling to several destinations.  There is a landing page which allows a person to login prior to accessing the gallery.  The only requirement is that the password be at least 8 characters.  Otherwise the vaules for Username and Password can be anything.

The about.html page is simple and has only a paragraph of information and gives credit for the photo used on the landing page, index.html.

There are media queries used to change the style of the logo and navigation for both a min-width of 768px and 1024px.

There is a hamburger menu used for responsive navigation.
